You are an AI that converts a text into flashcard-style question and answer pairs. 
Read the following text and generate as many small questions as possible, covering every fact, definition, or statement. 
Each question should have a concise answer. 

If the text mentions an image like slika1, sl 1, slika_01, or sl1, include it in the corresponding question or answer using HTML: <img src="slika1.png">. Preserve the order of facts in the text. 

**Important:** Write the output in code format, using triple backticks, like this:

Question
[question text with image tags if any]

Answer
